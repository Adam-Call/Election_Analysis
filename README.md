# Election_Analysis

## Project Overview
A Colorado Board of Elections employee has given you the following task to complete the election audit of a recent local congressional election.

1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
5. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.

## Resources 
- Data Source: election_results.csv
- Software: Python 3.7.6, Visual Studio Code, 1.54.3  

## Summary 
The analysis of the election show that:
- There were 369,711 votes cast in the election.
- The candidates were:
    - Charles Casper Stockham
    - Diana DeGette
    - Raymon Anthony Doane
- The candidate results were:
    - Candidate Charles Casper Stockham received 23.0% of the vote and 85,213 number of the votes.
    - Candidate Diana DeGette received 73.8% of the vote and 272,892 number of the votes.
    - Candidate Raymon Anthony Doane received 3.1% of the vote and 11,606 number of the votes.
- The winner of the election was:
    - Candidate Diana DeGette, who received 73.8% of the vote and 272,892 number of the votes.
 
 ## Challenge Overview
 The challenge of this project is to establish a working code that will allow for future use and be able to be used with a larger data set like for the entire state. So creating a code that was structured in a way that allowed for minimal changes and have the same level of detail in the output.
 ## Challenge Summary
By changing the variable created "file_to_load" to a different CSV file all that would be necessary would be to update the path that was used in the script. With that one line redirected to the new CSV the output would yield our new results for upcoming elections. By making similar changes to the "file_to_save" variable we can easily change where the results would be published.
